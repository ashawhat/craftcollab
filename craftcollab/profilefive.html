<p>29878 Calle Edmundo Menifee, CA 92586</p>

<p>I travel a lot.  Into dark and bold, or classic color palettes. Feminist. I think I'm always learning, reading, creating....maybe mostly sleeping. Plants and the natural world, and the mystical world. Current dreams include speaking Mandarin fluently, working in the art world, more published writing, and snuggling animals (horses, pandas, persian/himalayan/maine coon cats, mini pig) </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Tech, Women's Studies, Alternative Step-Mom Lifestyling, Campers, Exploring the Ideas of "Marriage" and "Home," Books, Dainty Statement Pieces</p>
