<p>I like dark &amp; bold, or classic, traditional color palettes. Feminist. Each day I try to learn, read, or craft, and almost always oversleep. I love plants, animals, the natural world, and the mystical world. I'm learning to speak in Chinese! </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Tech, Women's Studies, Alternative Step-Mom Lifestyling, Campers, Exploring the Ideas of "Marriage" and "Home," All Books Everywhere, and Dainty Statement Fashion Pieces</p>
